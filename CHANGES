In order to keep everything consistent, it may be useful to remove the
'start', 'done', and 'abandon' from the 'git-convey' level. The idea is that
'git-convey' is dependent on external task and release systems that create the
reference and then accept/reject/abandon the working branches.

Instead, we will want to add 'merge' which take the changes on the branch
since it was cut and attempt to apply them to another topic or release. That
is, the changes are moved from one topic/release to another.

The downside is that this conception is a bit more rigid and limits the
usefulness of git-convey. Perhaps we could design things such that it can work
either way; a 'standalone' vs 'integrated' mode.
