APPENDIX: Plain Language Analysis

Plain Language Info

Analyzing the license text between and including 'Summary' through the final
section (vanilla.txt):

* contains 339 (3), 369 (1), and 340 (2) words, 
* 125 'difficult words' (1); 90% of the total words appear on the
  Oxford 3000(c) common word list (3)
* has an average sentence length of 7.1 (1) and 12.1 (2).

The highest grade level equivalent score is 11-12th grade--based on the
Dale-Chali Readability score of 8.9 (1). The mean of the other scoring
mechanisms gives a mean grade level score of 7.8 (2).

3) http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/oxford3000/oxford_3000_profiler.html

Our arbitrary targets for this document where maximum grade level of '12th'
from any source and less than 500 words total. We removed each section from
the final version to determine the impact of each part, and have determined
the text is near it's natural limit. Any significant further simplification
would likely require a radically different approach.

The printed license should fit easily on a single page. This was true when
printing the vanilla license with Chrome version 31.0.1650.63 as well as OSX
10.9 'TextEdit' using 10 pt fonts.
