<div id="Issue-Specification" class="blurbSummary grid_12">
  <div class="blurbTitle">Issue Specification</div>
  <div class="p">
    In order to be considered fully specified, an issue must
    define <em>when</em> the issue needs to be tackled, <code>why</code> it
    needs to be done, and <em>what</em> needs to be
    done. Issues <em>should</em> when possible further specify the general
    work category, as defined by the particular project.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    You may notice that the 'what' and 'how' are not specified by the
    issue. This is because these aspects are determined by the developer who
    takes the issue on, and not by the issue itself.
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>When</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    In the standard system, we define three possible values for 'when' an
    issue should be tackled: <code>now</code>, <code>whenever</code>,
    and <code>not yet</code>. While these <em>may</em> be modified we believe
    that for for most projects these will be will be sufficient.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    <code>now</code> are the urgent items. <code>whenever</code> items are
    available for processing, but not urgent. Generally, workers are
    encouraged through structure and incentive to focus on <code>now</code>
    items over <code>whenever</code> items. <code>not yet</code> items are
    still being specified and are not themselves available for processing.
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>Why</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    Our 'why' model is simiarly simple and we again define three options:
    'bug', 'question', and 'change'. The 'why' gives us or second level
    ordering, to wit:
    <ol>
      <li>bugs <em>should</em> be addressed before</li>
      <li>questions <em>should</em> be answered before</li>
      <li>changes are implemented.</li> 
    </ol>
    Projects are free do define additional 'why' labels, but all why labels
    must map onto one of the three fundamental types.
  </div>
  <div data-perspective="detailed">
    Again, these three options may seem anemic compared to most systems, and
    again, the idea is that if you look at how issues are actually processed,
    you don't need anything more than this. Code correctness is always
    paramount and uncertaintity needs to be dispelled because changes should
    only be implemnted on stable code with clear direction.
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>What</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    'What' simply declare what the output of the issue is. This is meant as a
    first order division to allow processors to focus on a group of issues
    which match their skill set. It is not meant to be entirely descriptive of
    the issue requirements. That is <code>what: php code</code> means you at
    least need to know PHP, but it doesn't say enough to know whether any
    particular PHP developer is equipped to handle the issue or not.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Unlike <code>when</code> and <code>why</code> we expect
    the <code>what</code> values to often be editted and in general, conveyor
    logic does not make decisions based on these values apart from simple
    matching. Notice the convention is to use plurals for value labels.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    The <code>what: issues</code> label <em>should</em> should be accompanied
    with a second <code>what</code> specifier indicating the artififact that
    the to-be-created issue will generate.
  </div>
  <div data-perspective="detailed">
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader" data-perspective="detailed"><span>Custom When/Why/What Values</span></div>
  <div class="p" data-perspective="detailed">
    In general, custom when and why values <em>should</em> be avoided. We
    require that custom issues map onto one of the fundamental types so that
    general conveyor-flow logic can deal with them, and in practice we've
    never personally experienced a situation that, in our opinion, needs
    anything else. In practice, anything additional just introduces more
    cognitive load in issue specification without clear benefit.
  </div>
  <div class="p" data-perspective="detailed">
    'What' designations are often and properly extended. Again, if you don't
    need further details you shouldn't make difference for the sake of
    difference, but if you have more than type of 'code developer', for
    example, then you should designate the specific skills.
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader" data-perspective="operations detailed"><span>Technical Specification</span></div>
  <div class="p" data-perspective="operations detailed">
    The what, why, what designations are tracked by the folliwing labels:

      <li>when
	<ul>
	  <li><code>when: now</code></li>
	  <li><code>when: whenever</code></li>
	  <li><code>when: not yet</code></li>

<div id="Non-Topics" class="blurbSummary grid_12" data-perspective="detailed">
  <div class="blurbTitle">Non-Topics</div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>Priority and Value</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    Many readers may find the lack of any "priority" or "value" dimension
    surprising. In general, these are the most common and typically central
    attributes in issue management systems.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    The problem with these attributes is that they are not immediately
    actionable. High priority / value issues may be delayed for valid
    reasons. It may make sense to firt tackle low value / priority issues that
    are also low hanging.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    These values must be interpretted under some external set of rules which
    are not immediately obvious; that is, they require a-priori and ex-app
    knowledge. You need to the know the value to whom? Priority based on what?
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    In practice, a simple "when" is the better top level view. It's clear and
    gives clear direction to processors.
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>Who</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    Earlier versions of the issue specification used <code>who<code> rather
    than <code>what<code> and talked about writers rather than writing. This
    was initially done to put individuals into the process. It was changed for
    two reasons which collectively outweiged the benefits of <code>who</code>.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    First, <code>what</code> avoids limiting individuals. Dividing issues
    by <code>who</code> seems like a much harder question, at least for some
    individuals. "Who am I?" is existentially more weighty and fraught than
    "what can I do?"
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Second, the 'what' tends to be clearer and more concise than
    'who'. Compare "php code" with "php developer" and "help documentation"
    with "help documentation writer".
