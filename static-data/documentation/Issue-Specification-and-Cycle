<div id="Issue-Specification" class="blurbSummary grid_12">
  <div class="blurbTitle">Issue Specification</div>
  <div class="p">
    In order to be considered fully specified (created), an issue must
    define <em>when</em> the issue needs to be tackled, <code>why</code>
    needs to be done, and <em>who</em> needs to do the
    doing. Issues <em>should</em> when possible further specify the general
    work category, as defined by the particular project.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    You may notice that the 'what' and 'how' are not specified by the
    issue. This is because these aspects are determined by the developer who
    takes the issue on, and not by the issue itself.
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>When</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    In the standard system, we define three possible values for 'when' an
    issue should be tackled: now, whenever, and not yet. Individual projects
    are free to define further labels that carry meaning within the
    project. All labels must map onto one of these three fundamental types.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    The 'not yet' designation is useful to mark issues which have been
    started, and may be fully specified, but are for whatever reason are not
    ready for implementation. Specifically, a developer <em>should</em> deal
    with 'now' issues before 'whenever' issues, but <em>must not</em> deal
    with 'not yet' issues.
  </div>
  <div class="p" data-perspective="detailed">
    The 'when' maps more or less onto the 'priority' and 'value' that you might
    find in other systems. The problem with a priority or value based model is
    that information isn't directly actionable. To be fair, the 'when' doesn't
    itself fully specify the 'optimal order of address' for issues, but it
    does give us a clear first order sort. Another way to say this is that
    it's much clearer how to extract priority from this first level ordering
    of 'when' than it is to go the other way.
  </div>
  <div class="p" data-perspective="detailed">
    'Value' based issue systems are somewhat better than priority, but in
    practice tend to get used in a way that again fails to give us a clear
    order of operations. The bigger problem with 'value' is the question of
    "value to whom?" Most often, this is taken as customer value, but this is
    problematic because it leads to development concerns being continually
    sidetracked in favor of user visible issues.
  </div>
  <div class="p" data-perspective="detailed">
    In practice, the 'when' designation is really what we want. It gives us
    clear next steps for the issues. Furthermore, the three categories turn
    out to be enough. In practice, developers shouldn't care about anything
    other than 'now' or 'later'. Whether or not an issue is 'critical',
    'high', 'medium', or 'low' priority is idea that planners may&mdash;and
    should&mdash;deal with, but as far as the issue life cycle goes, 'when'
    turns out to be far more useful.
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>Why</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    Our 'why' model is simiarly simple and we again define three options:
    'bug', 'question', and 'change'.

    The what, why, who designations are tracked by the folliwing labels:

      <li><code>when: now</code></li>
      <li><code>when: whenever</code></li>
      <li><code>when: not yet</code></li>
