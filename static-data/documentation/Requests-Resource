  Requests to "do something" are created by creating
  a <code>/requests</code> item. All requests are tied to a
  primary <code>/repositories</code> item, and always involve the
  primory <code>/repositories</code> item. They may involve
  additional <code>/repositories</code> as well, both initially and at
  any point in the <code>/requests</code> item lifecycle.
