    Requests to "do something" are created by creating
    a <code>/requests</code> item. All requests are tied to a
    primary <code>/repositories</code> item, and always involve the
    primory <code>/repositories</code> item. They may involve
    additional <code>/repositories</code> as well, both initially and at
    any point in the <code>/requests</code> item lifecycle.

    All requests are associated with a repository. In some cases,
    there may not be much for the repository to do, but even so, the
    associatiation is still there. Although our requests are
    ultimately independent of a repository, this key association
    simplifies compatibility with third party repository services,
    allowing us to manage issues on GitHub and Jira, for instance. In
    particular, every <code>/requests</code> item ID must embed the
    path to the primary repository.<span data-perspective="detailed">
    Future versions will likely explicit support for
    unaffiliated <code>/requests</code>.</span>
