<div id="Basic-Model" class="blurbSummary grid_12">
  <div class="blurbTitle">Basic Model</div>
  <div class="p">
    The git-convey release management model makes use of two
    resources: <code>topics</code>
    and <code>releases</code>. <code>Topics</code> isolate changes to all
    project artifacts. <code>Releases</code> manage public runtime versions.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Every change on the system begins with
    a <code>task</code>. <code>Tasks</code> manage changes from a high level,
    planning point of view. <code>Topics</code> isolate changes at the lower
    level of bits and files. <code>Topics</code> (and <code>releases</code>)
    can be used independently as part
    of <a href="/documentation/git-convey/">Git-Convey</a>.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    When a <code>task</code> is accepted, a topic branch is cut from
    the <code>task</code>'s source branch. This also creates
    the <code>topic</code> resource, and the topic branch is managed by
    the <code>topic</code> resource. Changes are made within
    the <code>topic</code>, and then submitted for acceptance.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    When a submitted <code>topic</code> is accepted, the changes are merged
    back to the original source branch. If the source branch was already part
    of a <code>release</code>, then the changes are (more or less) instantly
    published. In most cases, the changes migrate back to
    the <code>master</code> branch.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    A <code>release</code> is cut from a source branch in order to identify
    and manage versions destined for public consumption. Again,
    the <code>release</code> is generally, but not necessarily, created
    from <code>master</code> branch. These release versions generally move
    through a testing phase before finally being promoted to a production
    runtime environment.
  </div>
</div><!-- #Basic-Model.blurbSummary -->
<div id="Release-Cycle" class="blurbSummary grid_12">
  <div class="blurbTitle">Release Cycle</div>
  <div class="p">
    A release cycle begins with the creation of a <code>release</code>
    resource, associated to a <code>release-&lt;id&gt;[-&lt;release
    name&gt;]</code> branch. The <code>release</code> is generally destined
    for a testing period, and the initial cut point is tagged
    with <code>release-&lt;id&gt;-RC1</code>, where 'RC' stands for 'release
    candidate'.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Further changes to the <code>release</code>&mdash;called
    bugfixes&mdash;result in incremental release canditates: RC2, RC3,
    etc. When the <code>release</code> is ready for promotion to a production
    environment, it is tagged <code>release-&lt;id&gt;-GA1</code>, where 'GA'
    stands for 'general availability'. The last RC tag always matches the GA1
    tag. From this point on, changes to the branch&mdash;called
    hotfixes&mdash;result in incremental GA releases.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    When a release is no longer supported, the branch and all tags are
    archived. Archived references are not visible by default, but are retained
    for historical purposes.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    This model easily supports projects with a single active release, as well
    as those with multiple active releases, demos, and custom versions.
  </div>
</div><!-- #Release-Cycle.blurbSummary -->
<div id="Topics" class="blurbSummary grid_12">
  <div class="blurbTitle">Topics</div>
  <div class="p">
    A <code>topic</code> is created to isolate changes to project
    artifacts. A <code>topic</code> is always associated to a single topic
    branch. Topic branches may be cut from any branch in the underlying
    project repository. We give special names to the topic branch to indicate
    the source branch type:
    <ul>
      <li><code>task-*</code> branches are cut from <code>master</code> or
      other <code>task-*</code> branches.</li>
      <li><code>bugfix-*</code> branches are cut from
      non-GA <code>release-*</code> and other <code>bugfix-*</code>
      branches.</li>
      <li><code>hotfix-*</code> branches are cut from a
      GA <code>release-*</code> and other <code>hotfix-*</code> branches.</li>
    </ul>    
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    Simple tasks may result in a single topic branch cut from
    the <code>master</code> or a release branch. More complex tasks may result
    in the creation of sub-tasks and associated sub-topic branches.
  </div>

<div id="Actions" class="blurbSummary grid_12">
  <div class="blurbTitle">Actions</div>
  <div class="p">
    Every action which would introduce a new commit can be isolated to one of
    six actions:
    <ul>
      <li><code>git convey update</code>: brings the local repository
      up-to-date with the remote <code>origin</code>.</li>
      <li><code>git convey start &lt;task|bugfix|hotfix&gt; &lt;task
      ID&gt;</code>: used to create a new branch where changes can be
      isoloted.</li>
      <li><code>git convey commit ...</code>: used to commit changes to a topic
      branch.<span class="note">This is essentially a synonym
      for <code>git commit</code>. Developers should prefer <code>git convey
      commit</code> anyway in order to keep the habit of consistently using
      the Git-Convey tool and because future versions may want to do some
      custom house keeping at commit time.</span></li>
      <li><code>git convey finish [[&lt;task|bugfix|hotfix&gt;] &lt;task
      ID&gt;]</code>: marks the current or indicated topic branch for
      integration back into the original source branch from which it was
      cut. Note that 'finished' branches may receive further commits, such as
      may be requested by the merge master, and be re-finished any number of
      times.</li>
      <li><code>git convey promote-testing</code>: archives the
      current <code>testing</code> <code>HEAD</code> and then forces
      the <code>testing</code> <code>HEAD</code> to the
      current <code>master</code> <code>HEAD</code>.</li>
      <li><code>git convey promote-release &lt;release ID&gt;</code>: cuts a
      new release branch from the
      current <code>testing</code> <code>HEAD</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    Most of the time, users will not need to concern themselves with the
    internal mechanics of the Git-Convey extensions. Developers should
    generally have a basic understanding of what's happenning in the repo
    whenever Git-Convey commands are executed, and of course Git-Convey
    developers will need to know exactly what's going on.
