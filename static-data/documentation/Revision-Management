<div id="Basic-Model" class="blurbSummary grid_12">
  <div class="blurbTitle">Basic Model</div>
  <div class="p">
    The conveyor-workflow revolves primarily around two
    resources: <code>topics</code>
    and <code>releases</code>. <code>Topics</code> isolate
    changes. <code>Releases</code> are meant for actual internal or public
    use.
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    The conveyor-workflow model includes four roles: project managers,
    developers, merge masters, and operations.<span data-perspcetive="detail">
    In practice, a single individual may handle multiple or all of the roles,
    or multiple individuals may act in each role.</span> Your own process may
    involve other roles, such as QA and client which support and augment the
    basic model described here.
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>Project Manager</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    Activity starts with the project manager who
    creates <code>issues</code>. In most cases, conveyor-workflow will use the
    isuse database to suggest next steps for team members
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>Developer</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    Anyone that makes changes to project artifacts is a developer in the broad
    sense. When a developer start works on an issue, conveyor-workflow creates
    topic branches and<span data-perspective="detailed">&mdash;and in most
    cases&mdash;</span><span data-perspective="!detailed"> </span>automatically
    manages issue status. The developer may commit and publish incremental
    changes and then ultimately submits the work.
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>Merge Master</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    The merge master makes the final determination whether submitted changes
    should be accepted. Conveyor-workflow handles notifying the developers,
    managing status and notes, and if necessary removing branches and
    deploying updates.
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>Sysadmin</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    Code released for general public consumption is always pinned to a
    particular release branch. Sysadmin create and manage
    these <code>release</code>.
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>Central Repo</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    You may continue to make use of gits federated repo model in development,
    but as far as the conveyor-workflow commands and process are concerned,
    the 'origin' repository is <em>the</em> central repository and your local
    copy is a 'working repository'. In practice, this means that
    conveyor-workflow commands will automatically resolve some conflicts in
    favor of the origin repo.
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>Topics</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    A <code>topics</code> item is a code branch associated to one or more
    issues.<span class="note">This is
    a <a href="https://github.com/DogFoodSoftware/conveyor-workflow/issues/110">TODO
    item</a>.</span>  Topics participate in
    the <a href="/documentation/conveyor-workflow/Topic-Cycle">topic
    cycle</code>.
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>Relaeses</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    A <code>releases</code> item is a code branch which is participating on
    the <a href="/documentation/conveyor-workflow/Release-Cycle">release
    cycle</a>. The release cycle consists of testing, public release, support,
    and sunset processes.
  </div>
  <div class="subHeader"><span>Git Compatible</span></div>
  <div class="p">
    Conveyor-workflow is entirely compatible with standard git. Feel to use
    whatever git commands you like.
  </div>
