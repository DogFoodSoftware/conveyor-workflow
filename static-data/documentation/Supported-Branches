    Generally any branch may be designated as supported. The most common
    purpose is for a release, and these may be referred to as release
    branches. In any case, the supported branch has been isolated from all
    other development and only receieves bug fix updates. The release notes /
    documentation should provide a description of 'level' of support provided
    on a branch by branch basise.

    Supported branches are most commonly cut from <code>master</code> or
    another supported branch. The branch is initially considered and generally
    designated as being a 'testing' branch. The testing phase proceeds until
    all tests and other designated release requirements have been met. At that
    point, the branch is designated as 'production', indicating it is ready
    for public consumption.

      In addition, all branches beginning with <code>production-</code> are
      reserved and should be taken to mean a supported branch. In general, the
      words following the <code>production-</code> prefix should describe the
      term or terms of support. Suffixing a date, such
      as <code>production-2013-12-31-thru-2016-12-31</code> is used in all the
      projects managed by Dog Food Software to indicate support for the code
      base branched from <code>production</code> on December 31, 2013 thru
      December 31, 2016. In other words, a 3 year support window.
