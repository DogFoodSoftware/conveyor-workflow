    <div class="p">
      A 'supported project branch' is a git branch specifically designated by
      the project. Designation as supported project branch (or just 'supported
      branch' in the Conveyor context) indicates that the branch will persist
      indefinitely and receive periodic updates appropriates as appropriate to
      the branch.

    <div class="p">
      In general, a supported branch may be created for any purpose. There are
      likewise no restrictions on the naming of such branches other than those
      imposed by git itself, though all names <em>should</em> avoid conflict
      with the standard normative conventions.
    </div>
    <div class="p">
      The standard convention is that every project should at a minimum
      maintain three fundamental supported
      branches: <code>master</code>, <code>test</code>,
      and <code>production</code>. The <code>master</code> branch maintains
      the most up to date implementation work. It has the most features, but
      also the most bugs and may not be relied upon for
      operations. The <code>test</code> branch is for stabilization. Feature
      work has been frozen and only bug fixes are allowed on the
      branch. The <code>production</code> branch is a best effort, bug free
      version. I.e., the lust fully stabalized code. In an ideal
      system, <code>production</code> is only patched when receiving updates
      fom <code>test</code>. TODO: this section is good, but probably should
      go under a branch management discussion. We could do a nice graph with
      the code cuts through time.
    </div>
    <div class="p">
      In addition, all branches beginning with <code>production-</code> are
      reserved and should be taken to mean a supported branch. In general, the
      words following the <code>production-</code> prefix should describe the
      term or terms of support. Suffixing a date, such
      as <code>production-2013-12-31-thru-2016-12-31</code> is used in all the
      projects managed by Dog Food Software to indicate support for the code
      base branched from <code>production</code> on December 31, 2013 thru
      December 31, 2016. In other words, a 3 year support window.
